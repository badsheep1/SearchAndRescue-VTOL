  <h1>SARV - Search and Rescue VTOL </h1>
  
  <h2>Motivations</h2>  
    
  <p>
    In disaster zones, time is critical. Our goal was to develop a UAV platform deployable in any terrain to rapidly survey areas affected by conflict or natural disasters and identify people in distress.

    By using an expendable aerial vehicle instead of sending in human rescuers, we aimed to reduce risk to unpredictable personnel while also minimizing setup time. The system is designed to be modular, lightweight, and adaptable. This enables fast deployment and real-time situational awareness in unpredictable conditions.
