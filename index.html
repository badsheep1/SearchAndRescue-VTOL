  <h1>SARV - Search and Rescue VTOL </h1>
  <section>
    
  <h2>Motivations</h2>  
    
  <p>
    In disaster zones, time is critical. Our goal was to develop a UAV platform deployable in any terrain to rapidly survey areas affected by conflict or natural disasters and identify people in distress.

    By using an expendable aerial vehicle instead of sending in human rescuers, we aimed to reduce risk to unpredictable personnel while also minimizing setup time. The system is designed to be modular, lightweight, and adaptable. This enables fast deployment and real-time situational awareness in unpredictable conditions.

    <p>This mount-plate and dovetail are fastened to the chassis of the DJI drone, it allows for different payloads to slide into and fasten itself to it, this modularity allows for effortless mounting and dismounting and swapping of differeent payloads.</p>

    <p>This payload structure integrates components essential for camera interfacing and onboard processing. The Raspberry Pi 5 manages ROS packages, while custom voltage regulator PCBs supply 5V and 9V power to individual modules. The Jetson Orin Nano handles computer vision tasks, including object detection and labeling.</p>
